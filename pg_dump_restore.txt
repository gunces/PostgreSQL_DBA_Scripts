# PostgreSQL has more options to get dump your databases. It's possible to generate dump files for your db objects.
# This example shows how to create a database's dump in basic and restore it.

# create dump file
pg_dump -p <port> -d <database name> -h <host> -Fc -Z8 > zipped.dump

# restore dump file
pg_restore -p <port> -d <database name> zipped.dump  -v

# Backup per databases in your cluster
# -C means, create the database itself and reconnect to the created database.
for db in `cat db.txt`; do pg_dump -d $db -C > /tmp/${db}_backup.dump; done

# Backup all databases
pg_dumpall -p <port> > alldb.dump
